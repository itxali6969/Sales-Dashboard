Mentorship: How to Build a Sales Dashboard
If you're planning to build a similar dashboard, follow these step-by-step mentorship guidelines:

Step 1: Define the Key Metrics
Before designing a dashboard, identify the key performance indicators (KPIs), such as:
✔ Total Sales Value
✔ Number of Deals Won/Lost
✔ Pipeline Performance (Opportunities, Deal Size, Gross Revenue)
✔ Upsell vs. Existing Sales
✔ Product and Sector Performance

Step 2: Data Collection & Cleaning
Extract sales data from CRM platforms (e.g., Bitrix24, Salesforce, or Zoho CRM).

Use Excel, SQL, or Python for data cleaning and transformation.

Ensure all data is accurate, updated, and structured before visualizing.

Step 3: Choose the Right BI Tool
For visualization, use tools like:
📊 Power BI – Best for interactive dashboards with filters and drill-downs.
📈 Tableau – Suitable for advanced analytics with AI-driven insights.
🟢 Excel Dashboard – If you're handling smaller datasets.

Step 4: Create Data Visualizations
Use bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, and KPI cards to display insights.

Apply conditional formatting to highlight trends in sales performance.

Ensure the dashboard layout is simple, clear, and user-friendly.

Step 5: Implement Filters & Interactivity
Add date filters (e.g., select sales for September, October, etc.).

Include manager-wise filters to analyze team performance.

Provide an export feature (PDF/Excel) for reports.

Step 6: Performance Tracking & Iteration
Regularly update sales data and analyze trends.

Identify bottlenecks in the sales funnel.

Adjust the sales strategy based on data-driven insights.
